## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure youâ€™ve added the necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist`.

2. **Launching the View**: Initialize essential widgets, check, and request for camera permission before launching KinesteX.

```dart
void _checkCameraPermission() async {
   if (await Permission.camera.request() != PermissionStatus.granted) {
      _showCameraAccessDeniedAlert();
   }
}

void _showCameraAccessDeniedAlert() {
   showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
         return AlertDialog(
            title: const Text("Camera Permission Denied"),
            content: const Text("Camera access is required for this app to function properly."),
            actions: <Widget>[
               TextButton(
                  child: const Text("OK"),
                  onPressed: () {
                     Navigator.of(context).pop();
                  },
               ),
            ],
         );
      },
